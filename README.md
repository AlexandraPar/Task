# Task Circles

A program for searching the biggest circle that does not have intersections with other circles.

The user adds a file in the format to the examples folder .txt.
One line of the file represents one circle. Each line is set of comma separated values. First one is circle ID, then circle center, then circle radius.

The program contains a module which returns the index of the desired circle in the case of correctly entered data.
If the data is entered incorrectly, the program will end with the error code "-1".
In this case, the Google-test "CirclesDefaultFile" will have the status " FAILED"

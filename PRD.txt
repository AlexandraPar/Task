The program has a module that searches for a circle that does not intersect with other circles and has the largest radius.

The main function "circles" is defined in circles.h file, implemented in circles.cpp file.

To test the module, Google-test is created, which uses the file path as input.txt containing the data to be processed. One line of the file represents one circle. Each line is a set of comma separated values. First one is circled, the circle center, the circle radius.

The program contains a module which returns the index of the desired circle in the case of correctly entered data. If the data is entered incorrectly, the program will end with the error code "-1". In this case, the Google-test "CirclesDefaultFile" will have the status " FAILED".

For automatic testing of versions on the repository, using the CI (Continuous Integration like) systems of TravisCI and AppVeydor.
